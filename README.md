# What is vSMTP ?

vSMTP is a next-gen *Mail Transfer Agent* (MTA), faster, safer and greener.

- It is 100% built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
- It is lighting fast.
- It is modular and highly customizable.
- It has a complete filtering system.
- It is actively developed and maintained.

## Faster, Safer, Greener

While optimizing IT resources becomes an increasing challenge, computer attacks remain a constant problem.

Every day, over 300 billion emails are sent and received in the world. Billions of attachments are processed, analyzed and delivered, contributing to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

To meet these challenges, viridIT is developing a new technology of email gateways, also called vSMTP.

Follow us on [viridit.com](https://viridit.com)

## Filtering

vSMTP enable you to create complex set of rules to filter your emails using [vSMTP's scripting language (vsl)](https://vsmtp.rs/reference/vSL/vsl.html) based on [Rhai](https://github.com/rhaiscript/rhai).
You can:

- inspect / modify the content of incoming emails.
- forward and deliver emails locally or remotely.
- connect to databases.
- run commands.
- quarantine emails.

and much more.

```js
// -- database.vsl
// here we declare our services.
// connect to a database with the csv format.
service greylist db:csv = #{
  connector: "/db/greylist.csv",
  access: "O_RDWR",
  refresh: "always",
  delimiter: ',',
};
```

```js
// -- main.vsl
// here we declare our rules for filtering.

import "database" as db;

#{
  // hook on the 'mail from' stage. (when the server receives the `MAIL FROM:` command)
  mail: [
    rule "greylist" || {

      let sender = mail_from();

      // is the user in our greylist ?
      if db::greylist.get(sender) == [] {
        // it does not, we add the address to the database, then deny the email.
        db::greylist.set([ sender ]);
        deny()
      } else {
        // it is, we accept the email.
        accept()
      }
    }
  ],
}
```

## Benchmarks

Comparison between Postfix 3.6.4 & vSMTP 1.0.1 performances, performed on a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS running with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core Processor.
